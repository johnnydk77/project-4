Project Description

Pair it. A new app for learning about wine pairing.

One of the questions that I get asked very often is what wine to drink with what food? This is called a pairing. A pairing allows someone to enhance their experience with not only wine, but how the wine enhances the dining experience as well.

This React on Rails app will allow the user to pair a wine with their meal. With features that include information on a wine that enhances an individual ingredient, as well as giving the user key wine description information to help them going forward.

Additional features will include links to additional wine resources that enhance the users everday enjoyment (i.e. how to use a winetool, how to properly open a bottle, how to decant, why and when to decant, links to additional resources).

This app is made to be a beginners guide to wine pairing.
Pair it will help take the fuss out of something that is meant to be enjoyable and accessible to all!

MVP/PostMVP - 5min
The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP. Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.


MVP
Build and use an api
Render data on page for Search by Ingredients
Render date on page for Search by wine
Embedded Video Instructions for wine basics
Links to additional wine knowledge
Wine description glossary
Styling
Css Animations


PostMVP
